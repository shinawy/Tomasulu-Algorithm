There are four files 
	input.txt: 
		type in your instruction, each on a single line for the program to properly read them. 

	Tomasulu.cpp: 
		the main function in which we will be reading instruction from the file 
		and validating them before we push it to the vector of instructions; 
	Func.h: 
		this contains all the functions we use for either validating, creating 
		or printing the instruction information,and also all the functions 
		handeling the different stages in Tomasulu 
	Struct.h: 
		This contains all the structs we need to simulate the algorithm fine
